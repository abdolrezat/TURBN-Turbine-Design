# TURBN-Turbine-Design
A MATLAB GUI for calculating detailed properties of multi-stage axial turbines. See the interface screenshots or just run the code, it's pre-loaded with examples!

# Algorithms
The code is mainly based on Mattingly's "Elements of Propulsion", it is named TURBN after the actual program which is not available on the internet. It does solve the problems in the book so it would be a useful resource for students.
see the figures folder for screenshots and algorithms flowchart.

# Run the program
Run the `Turbine_StageDesign_v2.m` script in MATLAB.
Properties of a two-stage axial turbine is already loaded into the program. It can be run with one click!
